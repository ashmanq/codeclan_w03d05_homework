# CodeClan Cinema App
This app demonstrates the use of CRUD operations between a Ruby app and an SQL database. The app carries out the following:
* Create customers, films and tickets
* CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete) customers, films and tickets.
* Show which films a customer has booked to see, and see which customers are coming to see one film.
* Buying tickets decreases the funds of the customer by the price
* Check how many tickets were bought by a customer
* Check how many customers are going to watch a certain film
* Create a screenings table that lets us know what time films are showing
* Find out what the most popular time is (most tickets sold) for a given film
* Limit the available tickets for screenings.

# Run App
To run the app use the following command in terminal:
```Ruby
